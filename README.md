Modern GL
=========

Attempting to do OpenGL the "modern" way.

Modern OpenGL deprecates a lot of what we're used to. The new way seems to
require writing a lot of boilerplate or using lots of additional libraries
just to get simple stuff on the screen. I'm attempting to implement some of
this boilerplate in a nice reusable package.
